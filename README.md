### Bachelor Praktikum WS 2015/2016

Octopus is a Client-/Server-application for recording video (or images) from multiple sources in a network to one central server.

If you have 4 Raspberry Pis for example, you can have one act as a central server and 3 as clients, which provide the server video data (for example from a Webcam). The GUI for the server is written in Qt5.
