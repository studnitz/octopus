 * @brief The Server class inherits from QTcpServer. It is the core of the
 * complete system and also a single-point-of-failure, so be careful with it.
 * Server is responsible for the communication with the clients. Also it
 * receives information from the GUI (to be precise the GUI has a GuiInterface
 * object, to which it passes information. The Gui Interface Object then
 * communicates via TCP with the ServerInterface object. The ServerInterface
 * object again has a reference to this class (Server), so it can pass the
 * information on again.
