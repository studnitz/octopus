/**
 * @brief The MainWindow class is the frontend and main user interface of
 * octopus. It's code and therefore also its functionality was divided into the
 * RecordingView and PlaybackView classes. Since the GUI does not necessarily
 * have to be on the same device that the server is, the GUI has to communicate
 * with the Server. Becase the application should be reliable we decided for a
 * TCP-based communication. That's what GUI-Interface is for.
 *
 * The Recording-Tab contains the functionality for starting and stopping a
 * recording, as well as the list of clients and their status. The ClientList
 * however is still implemented in the MainWindow class since it doesn't really
 * have anything to do with the recording itself. Each Client in this list is
 * represented by ClientGui.
 *
 * The Playback-Tab contains a list of .off files (octopus looks for them in a
 * subfolder called recordings). Each .off file corresponds to a Recording. When
 * double-clicking on an .off file, the contained Recording is loaded and
 * VideoPlayer-objects are created. Those can be right-clicked on, so a context
 * menu openes. From there the user can delete players or change their position.
 * This is handled by PlayerSettingsDialog.
 *
 * A menu bar exists in the top of the window. The corresponding functionality
 * is beeing held by SettingsDialog.
